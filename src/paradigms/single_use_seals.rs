//! # Single-use-seals
//!
//! Set of traits that allow to implement Peter's Todd **single-use seal**
//! paradigm. Information in this file partially contains extracts from Peter's
//! works listed in "Further reading" section.
//!
//! ## Single-use-seal definition
//!
//! Analogous to the real-world, physical, single-use-seals used to secure
//! shipping containers, a single-use-seal primitive is a unique object that can
//! be closed over a message exactly once. In short, a single-use-seal is an
//! abstract mechanism to prevent double-spends.
//!
//! A single-use-seal implementation supports two fundamental operations:
//! * `Close(l,m) → w` — Close seal l over message m, producing a witness `w`.
//! * `Verify(l,w,m) → bool` — Verify that the seal l was closed over message
//! `m`.
//!
//! A single-use-seal implementation is secure if it is impossible for an
//! attacker to cause the Verify function to return true for two distinct
//! messages m1, m2, when applied to the same seal (it is acceptable, although
//! non-ideal, for there to exist multiple witnesses for the same seal/message
//! pair).
//!
//! Practical single-use-seal implementations will also obviously require some
//! way of generating new single-use-seals:
//! * `Gen(p)→l` — Generate a new seal basing on some seal definition data `p`.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! **Single-use-seal**: a commitment to commit to some (potentially unknown)
//!   message. The first commitment (i.e. single-use-seal) must be a
//!   well-defined (i.e. fully specified and unequally identifiable
//!   in some space, like in time/plance or within a given formal informational
//!   system).
//! **Closing of a single-use-seal over message**: a fulfilment of the first
//!   commitment: creation of the actual commitment to some message in a form
//!   unequally defined by the seal.
//! **Witness**: data produced with closing of a single use seal which are
//!   required and sufficient for an independent party to verify that the seal
//!   was indeed closed over a given message (i.e. the commitment to the message
//!   had being created according to the seal definition).
//!
//! NB: It's important to note, that while its possible to deterministically
//!   define was a given seal closed it yet may be not possible to find out
//!   if the seal is open; i.e. seal status may be either "closed over message"
//!   or "unknown". Some specific implementations of single-use-seals may define
//!   procedure to deterministically prove that a given seal is not closed (i.e.
//!   opened), however this is not a part of the specification and we should
//!   not rely on the existence of such possibility in all cases.
//!
//! ## Trait structure
//!
//! The module defines trait [SingleUseSeal] that can be used for implementation
//! of single-use-seals with methods for seal close and verification. A type
//! implementing this trait operates only with messages (which is represented
//! by [Message] type alias – in fact any type that implements `AsRef<[u8]>`,
//! i.e. can be represented as a sequence of bytes) and witnesses (which is
//! represented by an associated type [SingleUseSeal::Witness]). At the same time,
//! [SingleUseSeal] can't define seals by itself — and also knows nothing about
//! whether the seal is in fact closed: this requires a "seal medium": a proof
//! of publication medium on which the seals are defined.
//!
//! The module provides two options of implementing sch medium: synchonous
//! [SealMedium] and asynchronous [AsyncSealMedium].
//!
//! ## Sample implementation
//!
//! Examples of implementations can be found in [bp::seals][crate::bp::seals]
//! module of the crate source code.
//!
