# LNP/BP Core Library

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp)

This is Rust library implementing LNP/BP specifications 
<https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs>. It can be used to simplify development of
layer 2 & 3 solutions on top of Lightning Network and Bitcoin blockchain. 

The current list of such projects include:
* [RGB](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rgb-node): Confidential smart contracts for 
  Bitcoin & Lightning
* [LNP node](https://github.com/LNP-BP/lnp-node): Experimental rust-based 
  modular Lightning network node
* [BP node](https://github.com/LNP-BP/bp-node): Indexing service for bitcoin 
  blockchain; more efficient & universal Electrum server replacement

The planned projects:
* Spectrum: Decentralized exchange for Lightning Network
* [Storm](https://github.com/storm-org): Incentivised trustless storage and 
  messaging
* [Prometheus](https://github.com/pandoracore/prometheus-spec): Decentralized 
  trustless computing

Potentially, with LNP/BP Core library you can simplify the development of
* Discreet log contracts
* Implement experimental lightning features
* Do complex multi-threaded or elastic/dockerized client-service microservice 
  architectures

To learn more about the technologies enabled by the library please check:
* [RGB Technology Guide](https://github.com/LNP-BP/FAQ/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/RGB%20Technology%20Guide%2C%20part%20I.pdf)
* [Networking with LNP](https://github.com/LNP-BP/FAQ/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/LNP%20Networking%20%26%20RGB%20Integration_final.pdf)
* [LNP/BP Nodes Initiative](https://github.com/LNP-BP/FAQ/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/LNP-BP%20Nodes%20Initiative.pdf)

The development of the library projects is supported by LNP/BP Standards 
Association.

## Library functionality

The library provides the code for:

* Improvements & utilities for Bitcoin protocol 
* Deterministic commitments that can be embedded into for Bitcoin transactions 
  and public keys
* Single-use seals
* Client-side validation
* Lightning networking protocol (LNP)
* Generalized lightning network

This code supports both Bitcoin blockchain and Lightning network.

## Project structure

The library is built as a single Rust crate with the following top-level mods:
* common: traits, structures, functions and generics which are used by all parts 
  of the project
* paradigms: generic paradigms (API best practices) which are not bitcoin-specific
* bp: Bitcoin protocol extensions external to [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) 
  functionality and existing [BIPs](http://github.com/bitcoin/bips). These may
  also cover those of [LNPBP standards](https://github.com/lnp-bp/lnpbps) which 
  are not specific for other layers.
* lnp: Lightning Network protocol extensions: networking, generalized lightning 
  channels and better layerization of
  [BOLT specifications](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc)
* rgb: smart contracts for Bitcoin and Lightning network based client-side 
  validation, deterministic bitcoin commitments and single-use seals.
* lnpbps: other LNPBPs standard implementation which does not fit into any of
  the categories above

The library is based on other projects:
* [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and it's dependencies
  * [bitcoin_hashes](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes)
  * [rust-secp256k1](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1)
  * [rust-secp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/ElementsProject/rust-secp256k1-zkp) 
    for Pedersen commitments and Bulletproofs used in confidential state inside 
    RGB protocols
* [rust-lightning](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning)

## Install

### Get the dependencies

On Debian, run
```shell script
sudo apt-get install cargo
```

On Mac OS, run
```shell script
brew cargo
```

### Clone and compile library

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/lnp-bp/rust-lnpbp
cd rust-lnpbp
cargo build --release
```

The library can be found in `target/release` directory.

You can run tests with:

```
cargo test
```

Please refer to the [`cargo` documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) 
for more detailed instructions. 

### Use library in other projects

Include this line into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
lnpbp = { git = "https://github.com/lnp-bp/rust-lnpbp.git", branch = "master" }
```

### Use command-line tool for LNP/BP:

We have developed a command-line tool [`lbx`](https://github.com/lnp-bp/lbx) 
which implements most of this library functionality, so it can be accessed and 
played with. Download it and build according to the instructions in
<https://github.com/lnp-bp/lbx>

## More information

### Policy on Altcoins/Altchains

Altcoins and "blockchains" other than Bitcoin blockchain/Bitcoin protocols are 
not supported and not planned to be supported; pull requests targeting them will 
be declined.

### Licensing

See [LICENCE](LICENSE) file.
