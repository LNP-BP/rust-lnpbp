# Recommended set of features:
# 1. Standalone node: `server` (=`node`+`shell`)
# 2. Cli to remote node: `cli` (auto includes `shell` and `integration`)
# 3. Mobile app talking to a server: `client`
# 4. Mobile app with embedded node: `embedded` (auto includes `client` + `node`)
# 5. Simple cli utility app: `shell`
[features]
# Server is a standalone application that runs daemon
server = ["node", "shell"]
# Feature is required for any applications that talks to daemon processes
# TODO: Consider converting this list of feature into non-optional dependecies
client = ["zmq", "log", "env_logger"]
# Embedded is an app that contains ndoe in itself and that talks to it through
# integration layer
embedded = ["client", "node"]
# Command-line application feature
cli = ["shell", "client", "serde"]
# Required for all apps that can be launched from command-line shell as binaries
# (i.e. both servers and cli)
shell = ["dotenv", "clap", "settings", "amplify/parse_arg", "serde",
         "log", "env_logger"]
# Besides server node can be run as a part of mobile app
# and other types of clients; thus `server` != `node`.
# This feature results in building with features not required for CLI

# TODO: Consider adding "rpc" feature which will be replacement for
#       any("node", "client") and will hold the features common for both
