//! Primitives module defines core strict interfaces from informational LNPBP
//! standards specifying secure and robust practices for function calls
//! used in main LNP/BP development paradigms:
//! * Cryptographic commitments and verification
//! * Single-use seals
//! * Client-side validation
//! * Strict binary data serialization used by client-side validation
//!
//! The goal of this module is to maximally reduce the probability of errors and
//! mistakes within particular implementations of this paradigms by
//! standartizing typical workflow processes in a form of interfaces that
//! will be nearly impossible to use in the wrong form.
